It's amazing how quickly time can erode our memories. It's only been three weeks since I worked on the Gitalk project, and I can't remember how I previewed the dev environment! Dang. (It was 1 am and I was tired)

Struggling through the code, I wished that my past self would have helped my future self by giving one little comment! It's a good reminder, to always keep notes in a safe place. A task that should have taken me 20 minutes, took a couple of hours.

So the question is where did I view my local Gitalk dev environment?
<p class="spoiler">I integrated Gitalk dev with Hexo dev!</p>

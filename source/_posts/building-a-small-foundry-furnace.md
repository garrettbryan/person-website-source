The construction of a melting furnace with limited tools is an interesting challenge; many times layout of complex curves is difficult. I wanted the burner to enter tangentially to the furnace wall; thereby, creating a flame vortex. The problem is how to layout the intersection of two perpendicular cylinders onto flat paper template? I wrote a quick Processing script that does just that. Just enter the cylinder's dimensions and the intersection point, then take the resulting screenshot, scale it to the proper dimension in Photoshop, printout, then tape to the cylinder to be cut. I'm going post the Processing script when I get some time to pull it off my linux box.

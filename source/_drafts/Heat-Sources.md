I've determined that the OSMF needsÂ [273 MJ per pour](http://outlyingoutlier.com/2014/04/21/power-requirements/ "power requirements"), the goal is two pours per hour. The most practical heat sources will be either propane, oil, or resistive heating. As a gas, propane is clean, easy to procure, but not very energy dense. Oil, as a liquid, is possibly messy, easy to procure, but very energy dense. Resistive heating will limit me to lower melting alloys, and I'd like to melt iron. OSMF type 1 will use propane only. This will allow me to verify the overall design.

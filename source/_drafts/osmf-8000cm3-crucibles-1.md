Crucible alternatives have been cruising around my mind lately, so when I saw an Ikea flower pot, I thought, "If only I could find a cheap crucible like this." Then aha that dim bulb flickered on.\[gallery columns="4" ids="389,390,388,387"\] The OSMF requires locally sourced cheap materials. What could be cheaper than an Ikea flower pot! When I compared the volume of an Ikea flower pot to my goal it's about 34% smaller. If the flower pot test show that it can work as an acceptable crucible then the low purchase cost may out weigh any durability issues. If the flower pot crucible doesn't work out then I will substitute for a real crucible of similar dimensions.

Many low budget melting furnaces use a section of steel pipe with a plate welded to the bottom as a crucible. A section of eight inch pipe with the same height as the Ikea flower pot is nine percent smaller than our ideal 8000cm3 case. For the furnace calculations I will use 8000cm3.

I'm designing an interchangeable burner system for the OSMF. I want to keep heating options open. I will use waste oil preheated with propane; yet, others will find  propane alone is adequate for their needs, and some may opt for resistive or inductive heating. As a gas, propane combusts easily when combined with a stoichiometric amount of air and a spark; however, liquid fuels must be preheated, then vaporized and then be combined with a stoichiometric amount of air before combustion can occur. Propane by itself is much easier and cleaner to use but requires a substantial volume in the tanks to maintain the required vapor pressure for any extended length of time.

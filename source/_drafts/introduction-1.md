Just a quick hello as I learn how to get this blog up and running. I will be blogging on the status of my current projects and the math and science behind them.  My hope is to inspire others by showing what is possible with limited resources, but also to receive constructive feedback to improve my work. Almost all of my projects are directed at obtaining my ultimate goal of building an open source 1kW stirling engine capable of being built in a rudimentary shop.  The projects I've completed thus far include building a small foundry from scratch and building a reprap printer. My self taught skills include shell scripting, PERL programing, some C++, pattern making (for metal casting), slip casting (for ceramics). I'm currently learning ruby to write plugins for Google's SketchUp (now Trimble's, hopefully they don't ruin it). With my ultimate goal in mind, I will use my reprap to make patterns and my foundry to make the castings. At this point, I'm able to print loose patterns and then cast them using a scrap aluminum alloy. Match plate patterns are my next step to increase the precision and minimize the imperfections of my castings. \[caption id="attachment_16" align="aligncenter" width="300"\][![](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_14441.jpg?w=300 "Aluminum Casting and PLA Pattern")](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2012/06/img_14441.jpg) Unfinished aluminum alloy casting and PLA pattern.\[/caption\] So stay tuned for updates on my projects. I'm looking forward to everyone's constructive comments.

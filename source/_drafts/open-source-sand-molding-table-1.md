A molding table is required for efficient sand casting. My table is made with half of a steel 55 gallon drum coated with some extra "brushable" urethane rubber I had lying around (a plastic drum could work as well). The inside of the steel drum should be painted to minimize iron oxide contamination of the sand. \[caption id="attachment_370" align="aligncenter" width="560"\][![Molding table and associated tools](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/molding-table.jpg?w=560)](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2014/03/molding-table.jpg) Molding table and associated tools\[/caption\] Since I do not have a sand muller, I condition the sand by hand using a spray bottle filled with water. I spread the sand out in the basin to maximize sand surface area, then lightly spritz the sand with water. I then mix and repeat until the green sand is able to break cleanly without crumbling. The conditioned green sand has a long shelf life if stored in sealed plastic tubs.

The OSMF is supposed to be cheap to build and repair, easy and safe to use, and durable. Designs of the tilting mechanism have been troubling me. Stephen Chastain uses a cable wench for his [oil fired tilting furnace](http://stephenchastain.com/store/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=1&products_id=3). His furnace is a monster and his wench system is lifting 1082 lbs with a safety factor of 5. I'm going to try a different route. The OSMF furnace is much smaller so different architectures are possible. I found a 1.5 ton [scissor jack at harbor freight ](http://www.harborfreight.com/1-1-2-half-ton-scissor-jack-66907.html) for under $20. Scissor jack strength varies with respect to jack height: [![1.5 ton scissor jack strength vs height](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/1-5-ton-harbor-freight-scissor-jack.png)](http://outlyingoutlier.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/1-5-ton-harbor-freight-scissor-jack.png) This chart is pulled from the [scissor jack user manual](http://manuals.harborfreight.com/manuals/66000-66999/66907.pdf).

I didn't notice a safety factor in the user manual, this will need to be determined before the build. The $20 scissor jack is the most cost effective solution found thus far.

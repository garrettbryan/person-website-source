Many people I meet don't see the connection between my diverse interests and resulting projects. I tell them it's for a stirling engine, then I have to explain that. This Blog is my project log. I hope to keep it updated with my latest endeavors, whether successes for failures. I've taught myself the basics of slip casting so that I may be able to build ceramic objects \[gallery\] I've built a Reprap Mendel 3D printer.
